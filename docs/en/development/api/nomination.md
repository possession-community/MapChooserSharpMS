# Nomination API

Provides functionality for players and server administrators to recommend (nominate) maps as vote candidates.
Nominated maps are given priority when building the map vote candidate list.

Access via `IMapChooserSharpShared.McsNominationController`.

## IMcsNominationController

Top-level facade for the nomination module. Provides access to services and managers, and event listener registration.

| Member | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NominationService` | `IMapNominationService` | Service for adding and removing nominations |
| `NominationValidateService` | `INominationValidateService` | Validation service for checking nomination eligibility |
| `NominationMenuManagementService` | `INominationMenuManagementService` | Service for displaying nomination menus |
| `NominationManager` | `INominationManager` | Manager for reading current nomination state |

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `InstallEventListener(INominationEventListener)` | `void` | Register a nomination event listener |
| `RemoveEventListener(INominationEventListener)` | `void` | Unregister a listener |

---

## IMapNominationService

Core service for adding and removing nominations. Handles validation, event firing, and state updates in one operation.

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TryNominateMap(IGameClient, IMapConfig)` | `IReadOnlyList<NominationCheckResult>` | Attempt a player nomination. Empty list = success |
| `TryAdminNominateMap(IGameClient?, IMapConfig)` | `IReadOnlyList<NominationCheckResult>` | Attempt an admin nomination. `null` nominator is treated as console execution. Empty list = success |
| `TryRemoveNomination(IMapConfig, IGameClient?, bool)` | `bool` | Remove a nomination for the specified map. When `forceRemoval` is `true`, admin nominations can also be forcibly removed |
| `TryUnNominate(IGameClient, UnNominateReason)` | `bool` | Remove a player's participation from their current nomination. If they were the only participant and it is not admin-forced, the entire nomination entry is also removed |
| `TryUnNominate(int, UnNominateReason)` | `bool` | Slot-based variant of `TryUnNominate`. For use in disconnect hooks when `IGameClient` is unavailable |
| `ClearNominations()` | `bool` | Clear all nominations |

### Nomination Flow

1. Player calls `TryNominateMap`
2. Internal validation via `INominationValidateService.PlayerCanNominateMap` (permissions, player count, day/time, cooldown, etc.)
3. After validation passes, `INominationEventListener.OnNominationCheckPassed` fires (external plugin additional validation)
4. If no external plugin cancels, `INominationEventListener.OnNomination` fires (final cancellation point)
5. All passed -> nomination succeeds, `OnNominationChanged` event fires
6. If rejected at any stage -> a `NominationCheckResult` list is returned

For admin nominations, step 2 uses `CanAdminNominateMap` instead, which bypasses player count, day/time, and permission checks.

## INominationValidateService

Service exposing individual validation conditions. Provides both composite check methods and individual check methods.

### Composite Check Methods

## INominationManager

Read-only manager for current nomination state.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NominatedMaps` | `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, IMcsNominationData>` | Dictionary of nominated maps. Key is the map name |

---

## IMcsNominationData

---

## IDetailedCooldownResult

Provides a detailed breakdown of cooldowns applied to a map. Includes both the map's own cooldown and cooldowns applied through its groups.

MCS cooldowns have two axes:

- **Count-based**: A counter set to the configured value when the map is played, decremented by 1 each time another map is played
- **Timed**: A cooldown that remains active until the configured duration elapses from when the map was last played

When a map belongs to multiple groups, each group applies its cooldown independently. `HighestCooldownCount` / `LongestTimedCooldown` return the most restrictive values across the map and all its groups.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HasCooldown` | `bool` | `true` when any cooldown is currently active |
| `HighestCooldownCount` | `int` | Highest count-based cooldown across the map and all groups |
| `LongestTimedCooldown` | `DateTime` | Latest timed cooldown expiration (UTC) across the map and all groups |
| `MapConfig` | `IMapConfig` | The target map's configuration. Can be used to reference default cooldown values |
| `CooldownCount` | `int` | The map's own current count-based cooldown |
| `TimedCooldown` | `DateTime` | The map's own timed cooldown expiration (UTC) |
| `GroupCooldowns` | `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, int>` | Count-based cooldowns keyed by group name |
| `GroupTimedCooldowns` | `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, DateTime>` | Timed cooldown expirations (UTC) keyed by group name |
